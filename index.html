                <h2>Selection of medicines</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="modal-body">
                <p class="definition"><b>1) All medicine donations should be based on an expressed need, should be relevant
                to the disease pattern in the recipient country, and quantities should be agreed
                between donor and recipient.</b></p>

                <h4 class="pop-head">Justification and explanation</h4>

                <p>The prime responsibility for specifying needs is with the recipient. This implies that
                there should be a clear agreement on which the donation of medicines should be
                based. The recipient should also be responsible for determining the quantities of
                products to be donated since appropriate quantification of needs is an important
                component of quality donations. Unsolicited, unwanted or unneeded donations
                should not be made, as they may lead to over‐stocking and expiry of donated
                products. There should be cooperation between the donor and the recipient from the
                initiation of the donation, through its planning, and until the final shipment.</p>
                
                <h4 class="pop-head">Possible exceptions</h4>

                <p>In acute emergencies, the need for prior consent by the recipient may be waived,
                provided that the medicines are among those on the WHO model lists of essential
                medicines1,2 or are included in the United Nations list of emergency relief items
                recommended for use in acute emergencies.</p>

                <p class="definition"><b>2) All donated medicines or their generic equivalents should be approved for use in
                the recipient country and should appear on the national list of essential medicines
                or equivalent or in the national standard treatment guidelines, if the NEML is not
                updated. Or, if a national list is not available, it should appear on the WHO model
                lists of essential medicines, unless specifically requested otherwise and provided
                with a justification by the recipient.</b></p>

                <h4 class="pop-head">Justification and explanation</h4>

                <p>Medicine donations must comply with national medicine policies, essential medicines
                programmes, and national treatment protocols.</p>

                <h4 class="pop-head">Possible exceptions</h4>

                <p>An exception can be made for medicines needed in sudden outbreaks of uncommon
                or newly emerging diseases. Not all medicines appropriate for those conditions are
                also approved for use in the recipient country in question. In such cases, donors
                should duly inform recipients of the regulatory status of products to be donated, and
                should obtain agreement.</p>

                <p class="definition"><b>3) The presentation, strength, and formulation of donated medicines should, as far
                as possible, be similar to those of medicines commonly used in the recipient
                country.</b></p>

                <h4 class="pop-head">Justification and explanation</h4>

               <p>Staff at the different levels of health care in recipient countries have often been
                trained to use certain formulations and dosage schedules and should preferably not
                be confronted with other treatment practices. Moreover, dosage recalculations may
                introduce medication errors.</p>

                <h4 class="pop-head">Quality assurance and shelf-life</h4>

                <p class="definition"><b>4) All donated medicines should be obtained from a quality-ensured source and
                should comply with quality standards in both donor and recipient countries. The
                WHO Certification Scheme on the Quality of Pharmaceutical Products Moving in
                International Commerce4 should be used.</b></p>

                <h4 class="pop-head">Justification and explanation</h4>

                <p>Double standards should be prevented: medicines of unacceptable quality in the
                donor country should not be donated to other countries. Donated medicines should
                be authorized for sale in the country of origin, and should be manufactured in
                accordance with international standards of good manufacturing practices (GMP).</p>

                <h4 class="pop-head">Possible exceptions</h4>

                <p>In acute emergencies, where pre‐stock or the emergency health kit are not in place,
                the use of the WHO Certification Scheme may not be practical. However, if it is not
                used, a solid justification should be given by the donor. When donors provide funds
                to purchase medicines from local producers, those which comply with national
                standards should not be excluded solely on the grounds that they do not meet the
                quality standards of the donor country. Strict criteria should be adhered to. See
                UNHCR’s drug management manual.</p>

                <p class="definition"><b>5) No medicines should be donated that have been issued to patients and then
                returned to a pharmacy or elsewhere, or that have been given to health
                professionals as free samples.</b></p>

                <h4 class="pop-head">Justification and explanation</h4>

                <p>Patients return unused medicines to a pharmacy to ensure their safe disposal. In most
                countries it is not permitted to issue returned medicines to other patients as the
                quality cannot be guaranteed. In addition, returned medicines are difficult to manage
                because of broken packages and the small quantities involved. Free samples given to
                health workers should not be further distributed as donations to other health
                systems.</p>

                <p class="definition"><b>6) After arrival in the recipient country all donated medicines should have a
                        remaining shelf-life of at least one year. Large quantities of donated medicines
                        become a logistical challenge, even with a long shelf-life. Therefore, based on the
                        national consumption and available quantities in stock or in the supply chain
                        pipeline, all donated quantities should match the needs to be consumed before
                        they are expired.</b></p>
                
                <h4 class="pop-head">Justification and explanation</h4>
                
                <p>In many recipient countries, especially in emergency situations, logistical problems
                    exist. Regular medicine distribution systems often have limited possibilities for
                    immediate distribution, and distribution through the different storage levels (e.g.
                    central store, provincial store, district hospital) may take a number of months.
                    Donation of medicines just before their expiry should be avoided as in most cases
                    they will reach patients after expiry. The argument that short‐dated products can be
                    donated in the case of acute emergencies, because of their immediate use, is incorrect.
                    In emergency situations the systems for receipt, storage and distribution of medicines
                    are often disrupted and overloaded, and donated medicines tend to accumulate.</p>
                
                <h4 class="pop-head">Possible exceptions</h4>
                
                <p>An exception may be made for direct donations to specific health facilities, provided
                    that (i) professional staff at the recipient institution are aware of the limited shelf‐life
                    and (ii) the quantity and remaining shelf‐life allow for use prior to expiry. A second
                    exception should be made for medicines with a total shelf‐life of less than two years,
                    in which case at least one third of the shelf‐life should remain, with a minimum of six
                    months. The national donation policy may specify the minimum acceptable
                    remaining shelf‐life for donated medicines.</p>

                <p class="definition"><b>1) All medicines should be labelled in a language that is easily understood by health
                professionals in the recipient country. The label on each container should contain
                at least the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) or generic name, batch
                number, dosage form, strength, name of manufacturer, country of manufacture,
                quantity in the container, storage conditions and expiry date.</b></p>

                <h4 class="pop-head">Justification and explanation</h4>

                <p>Health systems generally operate on the basis of generic names. All donated
                medicines, including those under a brand name, should therefore be labelled also
                with their INN or generic name. Receiving medicines under different and often
                unknown brand names or without the INN is confusing and can be dangerous for
                patients. In the case of injections, the route of administration should be indicated.</p>

                <p class="definition"><b>2) Donated medicines should be presented in pack sizes that are suitable for the
                recipient and appropriate to the setting in which they will be distributed or

                <h4 class="pop-head">Justification and explanation</h4>

                <p>Large quantity packs tend to be more appropriate for public sector supply systems in
                most recipient countries. They are less bulky and allow for quick and effective
                distribution and dispensing to patients. When possible, liquid formulations (syrups
                and mixtures) should be avoided because of their more demanding logistical needs.
                Where relevant, medicines for use in children should be listed in the WHO Model
                List of Essential Medicines for Children.</p>

                <p class="definition"><b>3) All medicine donations should be packed in accordance with international
                shipping requirements and should be accompanied by a detailed packing list that
                specifies the contents. The weight per carton should preferably not exceed 30
                kilograms. Shipments of medicines should not be mixed with other supplies,
                unless they are shipped as kits with predetermined contents.</b></p>

                <h4 class="pop-head">Justification and explanation</h4>
                
                <p>Easy administration, storage and distribution of donations is important, as the
                identification and management of items in unmarked boxes with mixed medicines
                and/or supplies is time‐consuming and labour‐intensive. The maximum weight of 30
                kilograms ensures that each carton can be handled without special equipment.</p>

                <p>Adequate coordination is needed between health “clusters” of the international

                allow for planning of receipt and coordination of the donations with other sources of
                supply. Information provision is part of the donor’s responsibility. Information
                should be made available well in advance in order to allow for smooth customs
                clearance and further distribution of products to end‐users. Pharmacists should be

                <p>When a donation of medicines is being considered, careful planning is very important,

                disease condition or an emergency donation of a large variety of medicines for general
                health‐care delivery. Coordination and harmonization between the donor and the recipient is
                essential.</p>

                <p>Utilization of the communication networks and mechanisms already in
                place is very important, as is sharing of information on needs and responses. To optimize

                <p>Roles and responsibilities in all phases of the donation should be established before the
                donated medicines arrive in the recipient country. Responsibilities for transport, customs
                clearance, reception, storage and distribution, administration, monitoring and evaluation
                and – where warranted – disposal of donated medicines should be agreed in writing and

                Monitoring and evaluation data may help to prevent the continuation or repetition of
                inefficient or harmful donations, modify inappropriate donation programmes, adjust
                forecasting and improve management. Evaluations should include assessments of the
                administrative process used by the donor agency, the adequacy of selection and forecasting,
                appropriateness of the medicines, timeliness of delivery and changes in treatment guidelines.
                Health cluster partners should collectively monitor the implementation of the overall health crisis
                response strategy and should ensure that the overall health cluster/sector response is evaluated.</p>

                <h4 class="pop-head">Phasing out</h4>

                <p>Long‐term donations may include medicines for lifelong use. Unplanned termination of
                these treatments may have serious effects so a carefully planned phase‐out is necessary. In
                most cases this would be a plan of how government funding would take over procurement
                and management of these medicines, including realistic estimates of the procurement costs
                involved and development of a scenario on how to budget for those costs.</p>

                <h2>Guidance to donors</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="modal-body">
                <p>In addition to shared responsibilities for both donors and recipients, donors should be aware
                of a number of specific issues within their influence.</p>

                <h4 class="pop-head">Needs of the recipient should guide the donation.</h4>

                <p>In the past, medicines have been donated in wrong selections and quantities, leading to
                situations in which stocks could not possibly be used within their remaining shelf‐life and
                therefore required costly and inconvenient destruction procedures. Donations should be
                planned on the basis of the needs of the recipient country. Competition between donors is
                unhelpful, and attempts to satisfy the most visible needs of the recipient may not be the best
                help that a country needs. The quality and appropriateness of the donation is more
                important than its size or monetary value. Despite tragic images shown in the media, it is
                necessary to work with general assessments of the needs, to wait for the country’s requests
                for aid, to maintain contact with organizations in the field, and to rely on relevant and
                adequate information before planning a medicine donation. On some occasions donations
                have been earmarked by the donor for specific activities or programmes. Whereas
                earmarking is understandable from the donor’s point of view, recipients should be allowed
                to apply flexible criteria when establishing priorities and meeting the changing needs of the
                population.</p>

                <h4 class="pop-head">Administrative arrangements should not be ignored</h4>

                <p>Donors should respect the laws, regulations and administrative procedures of the recipient
                country in all instances. Donated medicines should be treated as if they were procured. They
                should be included in the National Essential Medicines List (NEML). Shipments should be
                accompanied by documents to prove compliance with quality standards, including the INN
                or generic name, batch number, dosage form, strength, name and country of the
                manufacturer, quantities in the container, storage conditions and expiry dates. This enables
                the recipient to trace back the product in case of suspicion about the quality.</p>

                <h4 class="pop-head">The public in donor countries should be informed</h4>
                
                <p>Populations in donor countries are not always aware of the possible problems of medicine
                donations. Guidelines on the donation practices of the donor country should be in the public
                domain. It is important for governments in donor countries to create public awareness of
                “good donation practice”. The best moment for this is probably when the public appeal is
                announced in the media. In some cases an important message may be that donations of
                goods other than medicines, or even cash resources, may have preference.</p>
                
                <h4 class="pop-head">The recipient must have adequate capacity to handle the donation</h4>

                <p>Donated medicines should be entered into an inventory system, distributed through existing
                distribution channels and be subject to quality assurance procedures. Donors should ensure
                that the recipient’s capacity to manage the donation is sufficient and that logistical disasters
                are prevented. This includes the capacity to store (including a functional cold chain) and
                distribute, and functioning administrative systems. Donation planning should not start
                before a responsible party</p>

                <h4 class="pop-head">Remaining shelf-life of donated products should be discussed</h4>

                <p>Donations of medicines with short remaining shelf‐life have caused trouble for recipients for
                many years. Donors and intermediaries should prevent such poor practices. Interaction with
                recipients is of key importance in determining the acceptability of the remaining shelf‐life of
                products being considered for donation. Global experience indicates that well‐managed
                donor organizations and private sector suppliers are able to avoid donating products with
                too little remaining shelf‐life.</p>

                <h4 class="pop-head">Management of expired products must be agreed in advance</h4>

                <p>Appropriate disposal or reverse logistics of expired products must be agreed in advance. In
                principle the donor should accept responsibility for the destruction or withdrawal of
                donated medicines when necessary. Where national laws or guidance are insufficient,
                WHO’s Guidelines for safe disposal of unwanted pharmaceuticals in and after emergencies should be
                followed for destruction of expired medicines. Donors should ensure that a system is in
                place for collecting and processing complaints about donated products.</p>

                <h2>Guidance to recipients</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="modal-body">
                <p>In addition to shared responsibilities for donors and recipients and specific guidance to
                donors, recipients should be aware of a number of specific issues within their influence.
                These include defining needs and quantities, as well as planning and coordinating reception,
                storage and distribution. Recipient countries should have defined procedures for valuation,
                for entering donations in their budget records, and for the disposal of inappropriate
                donations.</p>
                
                <h4 class="pop-head">Define national guidelines for medicine donations</h4>

                <p>To be prepared for a situation in which donations of medicine are useful or needed,
                countries should formulate their own national donation policy and guidelines for medicine
                donations. National guidelines should preferably be formulated on the basis of international
                guidelines. In the national policy and accompanying guidelines, recipients should explain
                what kind of assistance – including medicine donations – they need, what minimum
                requirements medicine donations should meet, and what is not welcome. The national policy
                and guidelines should be officially presented and explained to the donor community and
                should be publicly accessible.</p> 

                <h4 class="pop-head">Needs for donated medicines should be well specified</h4>

                <p>The recipient is responsible for specifying the needs when a medicine donation is being
                considered. Recipients should carefully and precisely prepare requests, indicate the required
                quantities and prioritize items. In addition, it is recommended to specify the appropriate
                language of use on products and special medications for children. To avoid duplication,
                recipients should provide potential donors with information on donations that are
                anticipated or are already in progress.</p>

                <h4 class="pop-head">Minimum remaining shelf-life must be defined by the recipient</h4>

                <p>Recipients should be clear as to the minimum remaining shelf‐life that is appropriate to the
                national policy on medicine donations. To avoid unnecessary impounding and disposal of
                valuable donations, recipient governments should consider possible exceptions to their
                general rules on remaining shelf‐life.</p>

                <h4 class="pop-head">Rapid customs clearance of donated medicines is important</h4>

                <p>Rapid customs clearance is required for all donated medicines. Customs and health ministry
                officials managing medicine donations have the responsibility to allow entry of useful
                donations and to reject unsuitable donations. The criteria for acceptance and rejection of
                donations should be published in the national donation guidelines and should be
                communicated to donors.</p>

                <h4 class="pop-head">Incoming donations must be registered</h4>

                <p>Data on goods entering the country, who donated them and where they will go, should be
                registered from the start of any donation effort. Even in emergency situations, when aid
                arrives quickly and is sometimes uncoordinated, a central registry of all donations continues
                to be important. Such registries facilitate the management and organization of donations and
                promote transparency and responsibility. Registries should be developed on the basis of the
                national donation policy. Where possible, electronic systems should be implemented to
                simplify registration.</p>
